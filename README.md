## field-photographs

These Android apps were designed to ease photograph file management on archaeological projects.  The goal is to rename and place photographs on the filesystem in a structured manner, as the photographs are captured in the field.  Photograph file names are set based upon associated archaeological metadata, so that data viewing applications can easily connect the data with the image file.

**The usual simple workflow:**

1. The app requests the proper structured metadata about what is going to be photographed.  The user may either enter the data manually, or select data from an archaeological project's central relational datastore.
2. A photograph is taken with the Android smartphone, tablet, or camera.
3. Upon acceptance of the photograph or group of photographs, the photograph files are renamed and placed into an appropriate location on the filesystem, based on the selected metadata.  The final location may either be on the local storage of the Android device, or uploaded over the network to a central server via a web service.

Although initially developed for the data structures of Boston University's Gygaia Projects (www.gygaia.org), the simplicity of the workflow should allow adaptation to many situations.
