## field-photographs

These Android apps were designed to ease photograph file management on archaeological projects.  The goal is to rename and place photographs on the filesystem in a structured manner, as the photographs are captured in the field.  Photograph file names are set based upon associated archaeological metadata.

**The usual simple workflow is as follows:**

1. The app requests the proper structured metadata about what is going to be photographed.  The user may either enter the data manually, or select data from an archaeological project's central relational datastore.
2. A photograph is taken with the Android smartphone, tablet, or camera.
3. Upon acceptance of the photograph or group of photographs, the photograph files are renamed and placed into an appropriate place on the filesystem, based on the selected metadata.  The final location may either be on the local storage of the Android device, or uploaded over the network via a web service.
