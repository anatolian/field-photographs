## Survey Photography

This Android app enables the organization of photograph files at the point of capture, based on basic archaeological survey identification information.

A user locally enters the survey unit identification, and then can take photographs either of the unit being surveyed, or of the bag of samples collected from the unit.  Photograph files are stored locally on the Android device, enabling offline usage.

To build this app, create a new project in Android Studio, with the target API level of 15 (Android 4.0.3, Ice Cream Sandwich), then copy the files here over the default files created by Android Studio.
